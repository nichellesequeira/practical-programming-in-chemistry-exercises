For this example, we will sort the list in ascending order. If you were to draw out the list in a line, the lowest valued element would be in the first position and the highest value element in the last position. This introduces a nice property that for all elements, all elements to the left of it have a lower value, and all element to the right have a higher value.\n",

If `target` is greater than the middle element's value, we know it is in the right half. This quite neatly divides the problem in half.
